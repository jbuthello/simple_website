    <p id="prjp" style="font-family: 'Fasthand', cursive;">The process of writing a diary, journal, or daily planner is commonly referred to as journaling. It involves
      regularly recording your thoughts, experiences, and observations in a written format, often on a daily basis.

      Journaling can be a very personal and introspective process, as it allows individuals to reflect on their thoughts
      and feelings and gain insights into their own behavior and motivations. Some people use journaling as a form of
      therapy, while others use it as a tool for personal growth and self-improvement.

      The process of journaling can take many forms, depending on the individual's preferences and goals. Some people
      prefer to write by hand in a physical notebook, while others may use digital tools such as apps or online
      platforms to record their entries. Some people may write in a stream-of-consciousness style, while others may
      prefer to follow a structured format or prompts to guide their writing.

      Regardless of the specific method used, the act of journaling can have numerous benefits, including improved
      mental clarity, increased self-awareness, and enhanced creativity. It can also serve as a valuable record of your
      thoughts and experiences over time, allowing you to look back and see how you've grown and changed over the years.
