      <summary style="font-size: large;"><b>Return and exchange policies</b></summary>
      <p style="width:1200px; align-content: center; height:normal;">
        <b>Return Policy:</b> <br>If you have bought stationary and you want to return it, you will generally need to
        provide proof of
        purchase such as a receipt or invoice.<br> The items must also be in their original condition and packaging.
        Some of our stores
        may offer a time limit for returns, such as 30 or 60 days from the date of purchase.

        <br><b>Exchange Policy:</b> <br> If you have bought stationary and you want to exchange it for a different item,
        you will need to
        provide proof of purchase and the items must be in their original condition and packaging. Some of our stores do
        have a time
        limit for exchanges as well.

        <br><b>Refund Policy:</b> <br> If you are eligible for a refund, the store may offer a refund to the original
        form of payment, or
        offer store credit instead. Some stores may charge a restocking fee for returns.
        <br><br>
        It's always a good idea to check the return and exchange policy of the store from whenever you are puchasing the
        product before payment. If you have any
        questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact the our store's customer service for assistance.

      <p><b>Sizes:</b> Diaries, journals, and planners can come in various sizes such as pocket-sized, A5, A4, and
        larger sizes. <br> Pocket-sized options are compact and convenient for carrying around, while larger sizes
        provide more
        space for writing and organizing.

        <br><b>Formats:</b><br> These products may come in different formats such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
        <br>Daily formats
        typically provide a page for each day, while weekly formats provide a page for each week. <br> Monthly formats
        provide an
        overview of each month, and yearly formats provide an overview of the entire year.

        <br><b>Paper quality:</b></br> The paper quality of diaries, journals, and planners can also vary. <br>Some
        products may use high-quality
        paper that is thick and smooth, while others may use thinner, more lightweight paper. <br>Paper quality can
        impact the
        writing experience and how well the ink from pens or markers is absorbed.

        pen holders,
        elastic closures, and built-in calendars.<br> Some products may also be customizable with the option to add
